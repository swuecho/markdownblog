# the final language

I have learned a lot of language so far.

It is time to stop and make the final choice.

Perl is my first language. all most all my concepts of programming are from Perl.

R is the second and python is the third.

When I was in college, I also learned haskell, ocaml, and forth. probably, more, but I can even remember their names.

a little bit of C.

after being USA, I learned clojure, scala, scheme, and lisp.

After I graduated, I find my current job, programming in Perl and javascript.

Recently, I have configure uWSGI server for my company, which is written in C. To understand the api, I learned a little C along the way.

I wonder why I did not learn more C before.

so, I will focus on C in next few days.

I think my final language choices will be Perl, Javascrip, Lisp, C and Julia. Scala will be the last.
