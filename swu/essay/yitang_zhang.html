瞬间到处是张益唐的新闻。 

传言张益唐博士毕业后曾在快餐店打工，做过会计，一夜成名前也是一个美国一般的大学的讲师（老师中的最低低，按国内的说法是没有编制）。

传言，他与博士导师关系不好。

他博士导师发了一篇文章来介绍张益唐。

其中一段讲到找工作：


有时候我后悔当初没有给他找份工作。但是，又能向谁说？也许这就是他的命运，不过最终他挺了过来。

我确实给我的第一个学生找了工作，那是70年代末的事情了。我向我的朋友提及此事，他们都笑我，因为
老师帮学生找工作都是60年代以前的事情了。70年代后期，大学的聘用机制发生了变化，
时代变了，找工作是学生自己的事情了。我告诉他这些，不过他不同寻常。
他像那种志在北极的探险家，勇攀珠峰的登山运动员，不惧风雨的旅行者。
他从来也没有回来问我要过推荐信，也就是说，他从来没有找过教职。

直到今天，我也不清楚怎样做对他最好，不过当初我确信一点，他没法在当时的大学聘用体制下成功。
他需要的更多的是自由，所以，我就选择了放任。

他后来告诉我，他要去Rutgers University 和一个教授商谈。我祝他好运。这是22年前。


原文：

Sometimes I regreted not fixing him a job. But really, who could tell?
Maybe it was his destiny to endure and turn out to be great. I indeed got a
job for my first student at the end of 70’s. Later on I mentioned the episode
to my friends, they all laughed at me and told me that it was only the norm
of the long-gone 60’s. At late 70’s, we had a change of time, there was the
new term “tenure track,” and students should look for their own jobs. So
after he graduated, I told him the normal way of seeking jobs and looked
into his eyes. I found a disturbing soul, a burning bush, an explorer who
wanted to reach the north pole, a mountaineer who determined to scale Mt.
Everest, a traveler who would brave thunders and lightnings to reach his
destine. He never came back to me requesting recommendation letters. So
he did not seek a job. Even to this date, I do not know what was the best
for him. I was sure of one thing, he could not survive the process of the
“tenure-track,” “tenure,” “promotions”. I thought him as a free spirit, and
I should let him fly. He flew away after he told me he were going to Rutgers
University to talk to Prof. Iwaniec. I bid him good luck. That was 22 years
ago.
