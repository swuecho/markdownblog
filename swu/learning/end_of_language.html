# the final language

I have learned a lot of language so far.

It is time to stop.

Perl is my first language. R is the second and python is the third.
Scala is the last.

I have learned C , C++ and Java, but it seems that I forgot all of them.

Programming is not my final destination. Data analysis is, so I should 
stop learning language.
