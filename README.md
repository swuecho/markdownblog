## thanks.

I use [strapdown](http://strapdownjs.com/) for a while. For every markdown file, I add a little html directives and 
it render to html.

Serval month ago, I come across [docstore](https://github.com/haldean/docstore.git). This is really what I want.
I am in the situation to learn Jquery, so I end up writing my own.

the style.css is from [markdowncss](http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/)
